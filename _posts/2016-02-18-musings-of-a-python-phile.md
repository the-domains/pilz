# Musings of a Python-Phile

Tonight I am trying the impossible again. Buried in unhandled papers and invoices, with an urge to complete the tax declaration, I try to fix yet another last minute request that makes me delve into the depth of library code. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/65fc2efa-43b7-4016-be21-739fc0c079f3.jpg)

What is it that makes programmers stay awake for hours to get some small feature to work and what is it that makes everybody else think programming is as easy as clicking a checkbox or designing your own word template?

And what is it that makes developers have to fight so much of their time against entropy? I see a major problem in the inability of many to properly communicate to the world outside that even trivial looking problems come with a plethora of surrounding work that also needs to be done, but never is recognised as something that might take more than a minute. And then of course there is this tendency of looking at small things as if they'd collapse into one. Even if I have to do 100 one minute tasks, somehow it will only take one minute. It's a small thing, right?
